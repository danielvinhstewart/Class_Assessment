        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <p>
            The following Terms and Conditions document is a legal agreement between Arrow Media, hereafter 'the Developer', and 'the Client' for the purposes of website design or development. These Terms and Conditions set forth the provisions under which the Client may use the services supplied.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Developer is an Internet web design provider offering the Client graphical design, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and other related computer programming languages.
        </p>
        <h3>Acceptance of Work</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Quotations are valid for 30 days from date of issue.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the Client places an order to purchase a website or website updates from the Developer, the order represents an offer to the Developer to purchase the website or website updates. No contract for the supply of services exists between Client and Developer until the Developer sends an invoice to the Client for payment. The invoice equals acceptance by the Developer (or third party supplier) of the Client's offer to purchase services from the Developer and this acceptance of work is a valid contract between Client and Developer regardless of whether the Client receives the invoice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any other services on the order that have not been included in the invoice do not form part of the contract. The Client agrees to check that the details of the invoice are correct and should print and keep a copy for their records.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Developer is liable to withdraw the from contract at any time prior to acceptance.
            </li>
            <li>
                Additional work requested by the Client that is not specified in the agreed quotation is subject to an additional quotation by the Developer on receipt of specification. If the work is needed as part of an existing project, then this may affect time scale and overall delivery time of the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a functional specification and a set of testing criteria is included within the quotation, the Developer is responsible for fulfilling the testing criteria as the sole criteria for completion of the contract.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client agrees that the standard development platform is an agreeable platform for development of the website and all acceptance testing will occur only on the standard development platform. The Client further agrees that any requests relating to hardware or software outside the standard development platform will be deemed additional work.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client agrees to provide any needed information and content required by the Developer in good time to enable the Developer to complete a design or website work as part of an agreed project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any work is subject to a minimum charge of &pound;90.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Permission &amp; Copyright</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Copyright of the completed web designs, images, pages, code and source files created by the Developer for the project shall be with the Client upon final payment only by prior written agreement. Without agreement, ownership of designs and all code is with the Developer.
            </li>
            <li>
                These terms of use grant a non-exclusive limited license so that the Client can use the design on one website on one domain name only. The Client is not permitted to use a design for more than one website without prior written agreement between the Client and the Developer.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client agrees that resale or distribution of the completed files is forbidden unless prior written agreement is made between the Client and the Developer.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client hereby agrees that all media and content made available to the Developer for use in the project are either owned by the Client or used with full permission of the original authors. The Client agrees to hold harmless, protect and defend the Developer from any claim or suit that may arise as a result of using the supplied media and content.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client agrees that the Developer may include development credits and links within any code the Developer designs, builds or amends. If the Developer designs a website for a Client, then the Client agrees that the Developer may include a development credit and link displayed on the Client's website. If the Developer builds or amends a website for a Client, then the Client agrees that the Developer may include a development credit and link displayed on the Client's web page, which may be within the code but not displayed on a web browser if requested by the Client.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client agrees that the Developer reserves the right to include any work done for the Client in a portfolio of work.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Client agrees to abide by the terms of any third party software or media included within any work done for the Client. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, Google Maps, Media under the Creative Commons license, RSS feeds, Open Source GPL Software etc.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <li>The Client agrees that registration of a domain name does not provide endorsement of the right to use the name. The Client is responsible for ensuring they have due title to the domain name. The Developer holds no liability and the Client hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Developer from any claim resulting from the Client's registration of a domain name.</li>
            <li>The domain name is registered in the Client's own name, with the address and contact details of the Developer.

            <li>The Client agrees to take all legal responsibility for use of third party domain name and hosting services and supply truthful details to the third party services.</li>
            <li>The Client agrees that information submitted for registration of domain names is then available to the general public via the Nominet Whois system. However, Clients who are using their website for non-trading purposes may ask the third party registrar for their contact information not to be included in the Nominet Whois system.</li>
            <li>The Client is liable to pay the Developer for any domain name registrations and the initial set-up of the hosting if included as part of the website build.</li>
            <li>Any support relating to the domain name, hosting and email services is between the Client and the third party service.</li>
            <li>Any other domain name and hosting services or costs not included by the Developer, including but not limited to further domain name registration fees, domain name transfer charges, yearly domain name renewals, hosting charges, yearly hosting renewals, hosting upgrades, extra disk space, bandwidth and any other related or hidden charges, are to be paid by the Client to the third party services.</li>
            <li>The Client agrees to pay the domain name and hosting fees as soon as required by the third party. Any modifications needed to the domain name or hosting services are to be made between the Client and third party service.</li>
            <li>The Client agrees that if at any time their contact details, including email address, change, it is their responsibility to contact the third party and update their contact details. Failure to do so may mean that renewal invoices for the domain name and hosting services are not received by the Client.</li>
            <li>Payment for domain name and hosting services is to be made immediately on receipt of an invoice from the third party service. Failure to comply with the payment terms may result in the Client's domain name becoming available to another party and/or the website and email services becoming unavailable.</li>
            <li>The Client agrees to pass on FTP details and any other access details relating to their domain name and hosting account that the Developer requires to upload the website if required as part of a project.</li>

            <li>The Client agrees to be liable for their use of the domain name, hosting and email services with the third party and hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Developer from any claim resulting from the Client's publication of material and use of the domain name, hosting and email services.</li>
